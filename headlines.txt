7/26/2024, I will build an AI model everyday for 30, will see how it goes.

day 1: building and training a basic neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Tensorflow, the MNIST is a large data set that contains images of hand written numbers(0-9). 
results: 0.94 accuracy, 0.2 loss.


day 2: building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
results: accuracy: 0.6986 - loss: 0.9032, after data augmentation : accuracy: 0.7126 - loss: 0.8663 more epochs can imporve it much more, only 10 used



day 3:
